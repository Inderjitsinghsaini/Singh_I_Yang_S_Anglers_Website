			<h1>Brown Trout Release
</h1>
			<h2>Saturday, May 4, 2019</h2>
			<p>TRAA hatchery and released at the same site on Medway Creek<br> as in previous years.

TRAA members loaded up the trout fry into the transfer tank<br> at the hatchery site. We then proceeded to the release site north of London, Ontario.<br>
We were met there by two of the landowners through<br> which this section of Medway Creek flows. They also brought out a large<br> contingent of family and friends to lend a helping hand.<br>
This video gives you a pretty good idea how it went:<br> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl0FUUaXDks&t=2s<br>
It was a beautiful day, the stream was in perfect shape and<br> everyone was smiling and laughing.<br> Good times.</p>

			<h1>Medway Creek Habitat Project

</h1>
			<h2>Initial Stream Walk, March, 2019</h2>
			<p>Those of you who have been involved with the brown trout<br> releases over the past few<br> years may recognize this spot on Medway Creek as the release point.<br>
Those of you who have been attending the last few General Meetings will also know that this is part <br>of a 280-metre stretch on which we will be focusing future habitat rehabilitation efforts.<br>
We have met with and have the support of the two landowners through which this stretch of Medway Creek flows.<br> 
Back in March we put together a short video of our stream walk on this section of Medway Creek,<br> during which we documented areas in need of work and added our initial thoughts.<br> Here it is: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx4IH2KWOYE&t=53s"></a></p>

			<h1>Annual TRAA Paddle & Fish
</h1>
			<h2>Saturday, July 14, 2018</h2>
			<p>This year we be mixed it up a bit by having the Annual TRAA Paddle & Fish<br> on Sharon Creek Reservoir.<br> 

A thunderstorm threatened but only gave us a few minutes of<br> rain to cool us off.
Fish targeted were largemouth bass, crappie and other panfish as<br> well as some bruiser carp.
 
Many bass were caught with some crappies mixed<br> in to make it interesting. Paul Holmes ended up with the largest fish, a nice smallmouth bass.<br>

An informal BBQ lunch followed with Rick Ornato supplying<br> the grill and the cooking expertise - <br>Thanks Rick!</p>

			<h1>Stream Habitat Work Party
</h1>
			<h2>Thursday, July 12, 2018</h2>
			<p>We were very excited to have a group from the MNRF's Stewardship Youth<br> Rangers Program to do some work on Komoka Creek.<br> This program gives groups of 16 or 17 year-olds an opportunity to spend 8 weeks working <br>outdoors on natural resource management projects in their own community.<br>

They worked on clearing a section of Komoka Creek upstream of the TRAA trout hatchery.<br>  A major tree had fallen and a lot of the bank went with it.<br> This created a blockage and was diverting the stream, increasing the likelihood of further bank<br> side damage and erosion.

We were also fairly certain that this<br> was a barrier to migratory and resident fish passage.<br> </p>

			<h1>Work Party Hatchery RoofRepair
</h1>
			<h2>Saturday, June 30, 2018</h2>
			<p>As most members already know, a large tree was blown down during <br>high winds on May 2nd.
Ironically, barely a week before this happened,<br> we had already removed a couple of dead trees <br>that had been identified as potential hazards to the hatchery.<br> 

At the time, we thought this tree wasn't a threat as it was well up<br> the hill and well off to one side.<br>
It unfortunately glanced off of a couple of other trees as<br> it fell, steering it directly on to the hatchery roof!<br> 

If you have questions about this event or would like <br>to get involved with other hatchery projects, please contact us<br></p>

			<h1>Rainbow Trout Release
</h1>
			<h2>Saturday, June 23, 2013</h2>
			<p>This year we were pleased to welcome visitors from Chipewas of the Thames First<br> Nation, to tour the trout hatchery and assist us with<br> the release of more than 40,000 rainbow trout.<br>
Everyone was thrilled that the bald eagles with their young ones were<br> keeping an eye on the proceedings at the release site.<br>

This was another successful year and those volunteers on the trout<br> hatchery rotation are to be commended.<br>

The trout hatchery will undergo roof repairs as a result of a damaging<br> blow from a fallen tree.
Otherwise, the hatchery will be idle for the <br>summer except for routine maintenance.
If you'd like to be part of the hatchery<br> rotation and other TRAA activities just contact us.<br></p>

			<h1>Rainbow Trout Release
</h1>
			<h2>Friday, June 16, 2017</h2>
			<p>The rainbow trout fingerlings that we raised from eggs over this past<br> winter were released into Dingman Creek.<br>

This year the TRAA welcomed the ECO Club from Louise Arbour<br> French Immersion Public School, to come out and assist successfully<br> releasing in excess of 40,000 rainbow trout.

Both the weather and the water<br> conditions were nearly perfect, adding to a fun and rewarding <br>learning experience for these enthusiastic students.<br>

The trout hatchery is now idle and will undergo<br> some upgrades over the summer in addition to<br> the regular yearly maintenance. If you'd like<br> to get in on this and other TRAA activities<br> just contact us.<br></p>

			<h1>Family Fishing Day - Fanshawe
</h1>
			<h2>Saturday, July 9, 2016</h2>
			<p>This event has become another TRAA tradition. Members have been<br> helping the Fanshawe Campers Association with the Family Fishing<br> Day for many years now. 
We help the kids rig up, sort out the odd tangle,<br> help measure and release fish; we're just there to generally show them some fishing basics.<br> 
TRAA members that have come come out to this event in<br> past years find it both fun and rewarding.
We'll be setting things up at the Fanshawe Conservation Area's boat<br> ramp area starting at 7:30am so everything's ready when families<br> start showing up at 9:00am. The event wraps up at 1:00pm.
If you can only come out for<br> a couple of hours that's OK. That way <br>if we have members showing up mid to late morning, that'll<br> allow us to help out in shifts.<br></p>

			<h1>Brown Trout Release
</h1>
			<h2>Monday, May 2, 2016</h2>
			<p>The brown trout were successfully released with the help of 30 Grade 7/8 students<br> from Oxbow Public School.

It was good timing as the rain stopped just<br> as we showed up at the hatchery. Half of the <br>students went for a stream tour lead by Bill Vandewetering<br> and Richard Westelaken while the other half toured the hatchery operation. <br>
During the stream tour the bald eagle showed up<br> to its nest with a fish in its talons,<br> much to the amazement of our guests<br></p>

			<h1>Thames River Cleanup
</h1>
			<h2>Saturday, May 7, 2016</h2>
			<p>TRAA members met with another group to do our yearly cleanup of the area<br> around Komoka bridge (some may call it the Speedway bridge).<br> 

While a good amount of trash was removed from the area,<br> participants commented that there seemed to be significantly less to pick up than in previous years.<br> Let's hope that trend continues!

It's always a great way to get some <br>fresh air, light exercise and top up your commitment to<br>"give back".
Thanks go out to Jeremy Beaton<br> for organizing the TRAA contingent.<br></p>

			<h1>Angling Sports Barbeque
</h1>
			<h2>Saturday, May 7, 2016</h2>
			<p>There was hotdogs, burgers and lots of fun going on at this<br> informal get-together.

Paul Noble put his barbequing skills to the test supplying<br> a steady stream of hungry customers.
Ryan Simard spent most of his time trying to sell tickets for<br> the "Count the Bobbers Contest". Ryan was also the main guy in organizing and pulling this<br> whole event together - nice work Ryan!

Your ticket gave you a chance at a $100 gift<br> certificate courtesy of Angling Sports! As an additional bonus, you also got the equivalent of the <br>tax taken off any purchase in the Angling Sports store!<br>

All the proceeds went to benefit the TRAA and our projects.<br></p>
